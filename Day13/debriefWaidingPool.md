# Debrief Wading Pool

### Top 3 :
    During this Waiding Pool, I met many people and made new friends. 
    I feel more sociable and it's now easier for me to tchat with strangers.

### Worst 3 
    My three least favorite things :
    -Day 12, because I like working on projects but I don't like the way to create elements with the library pygames.
    -I had the base of Git, but during Waiding Pool I learned a lot of new skills.
    -I missed the last task on Day 4 for three days, and I tried three times again before succeding. It was pretty cool and a good challenge.

### Best practices
    - Write readable code
        -> respect indentation and spacing
    - Write the type of all parameters and variables
    - Write function doc string
    - Use understable variable names
